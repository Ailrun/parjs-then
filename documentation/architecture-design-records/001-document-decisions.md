The purpose of an ADR is to help future developers understand why a past decision was made.

## Context

## Decision

-   We will start writing ADRs. The ADRs will be short and to the point.
-   The ADRs will be written in Markdown.
-   They will be stored in the repository. We will keep outdated ADRs in [outdated](./outdated/)

## Expected consequences

-   Future developers will understand why a past decision was made. This will help them understand if the decision is still valid.
-   The ADRs will be easy to read and write. They will also be portable. They can be read easily in GitHub where we store our code.
-   Because the ADRs are in the repository, they will be easy to find. They will also be easy to update. Git will provide a history of changes.
